# Todo List:

Write the system described above. First of all, you should make such a system:

- (10 points) Can customize all collision balls.(This means that the program should be able to read
from standard input the initial state of all the balls.)

- (20 points) The program should be able to run and show the movement of the objects with GUI.

- (10 points) To collide and bounce according to the energy and momentum.
 
- (10 points) Consider the influence of gravity.
Test the accuracy and performance of your system.

- (5 points) Show that your program can produce the correct result.

- (5 points) Show the performance of your program.

- Test the accuracy and performance of your system. (10 points)

- Write your report. (10 points)

- In the last we will run some test we have
prepared on your program. That is the last 30 points of your project. This can only be down after your
code is submitted. We'll test your program by some cases. By specifying the number of objects and each
object's size, mass, position and color, your program's result should be the same with the standard
answer.
